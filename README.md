# QUOD Antifraud Demo - iOS App (Swift)

## 📊 About the Project

This project represents **the first phase** of the **FIAP Challenge in partnership with QUOD**. The functionalities implemented so far lay the foundation for a complete antifraud demonstration app.  

The second phase of the challenge, to be delivered in **May 2025**, will include the development of all core functionalities. The purpose of this app is to simulate the main authentication and fraud prevention solutions offered by **QUOD**, allowing the sales team to present the reliability and innovation of these solutions in meetings and client presentations.  

## 🚀 Features (To Be Developed in Phase 2 - May 2025)

- **Facial Biometrics:** Simulated face capture and validation  
- **Fingerprint Biometrics:** Simulated fingerprint scanning and validation  
- **Document Analysis (Documentoscopy):** Validation of document authenticity via image capture  
- **SIM Swap Verification:** Checking for recent SIM card swaps via API integration  
- **User Authentication:** Form to validate CPF, name, address, and phone number  
- **Fraud Score Calculation:** Displaying an antifraud risk score (1-1000)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Swift** as the main programming language  
- **UIKit** for building the user interface  
- **Core Data** for local data storage  
- **Storyboard** for UI design and navigation

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project is part of a **Challenge at FIAP in partnership with QUOD**.  

### **Challenge Description**  
The **QUOD** sales team needs an effective tool to demonstrate the functionality of their fraud prevention solutions and products in meetings and client presentations.  

The goal of this project is to develop an application that simulates the primary authentication and antifraud verification flows offered by **QUOD**, allowing sales representatives to showcase the reliability and innovation of these solutions, including new biometric and authentication technologies.  

This first phase establishes the **foundation** of the project, while the **second phase, to be delivered in May 2025, will fully develop the planned functionalities**.  

### **Topics Covered**
- **Swift and UIKit** for iOS development  
- **Core Data** for local data storage  
- **Storyboard and Auto Layout** for UI design  
- **Simulated authentication flows** for user validation  
- **Fraud risk assessment features**
